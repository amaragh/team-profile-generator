# Team Profile Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

Clone the repo, then from the command line, run `npm install` in the project's root directory to download any dependencies.

## Usage

The demo recording can be found [here](https://youtu.be/1EZn5_iB2Ps).

Navigate to project root directory and run the command `node index` to invoke the application. The application allows entry of one team manager and multiple engineers and interns. 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```



## License

Please see repo for license information.

## Tests

Run `npm run test` in project's root directory.
